Welcome to Garbify! 

Garbify is an AI powered garbage classifier I made that takes a picture input and classifies it into one of 6 categories: 
Plastic, Metal, Glass, Paper, Cardboard, and Trash

The idea is to ensure garbage ends up where it is supposed to be and to protect the environment!

To try it yourself, run the main.py file and a Flask application will open on a local server

Enter a picture and Garbify will tell you what it is!
